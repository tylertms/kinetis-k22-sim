# Kinetis K22 Simulator

C simulator for the 100 MHz and 120 MHz NXP Kinetis K22F microcontroller families and their Arm Cortex-M4 cores with FPv4-SP-D16 floating-point units.

## Features

- CPU Core: Armv7E-M instruction set (Thumb, Thumb-2, DSP, FPv4-SP-D16 floating-point unit).
- Core Peripherals: NVIC, SCB, SysTick, bit-band operations, MPU, breakpoints, and cycle-counted execution.
- Kinetis K22 Peripherals: Flash/SRAM, eDMA, DMAMUX, SIM, MCG, WDOG, PIT, LPTMR, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C, USB, GPIO.
- Device Profiles: MK22F12810, MK22FN12812, MK22FN25612, MK22FN51212, MK22FN1M012, and MK22FX51212.
- Device Packages: AK, LH, MP, AH, LK, AP, BP, FX, LL, DC, MC, LQ, and MD variants supported by each profile.

The 50 MHz K22D5 devices use Cortex-M4 cores without floating-point units and a different peripheral map. They are outside this K22F simulator's scope.

## Build

```
cmake -S . -B build/simulator -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/simulator --parallel
```

### Build Targets

| Target | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `kinetis_k22::simulator` | Static Library | K22 device and Cortex-M4F core simulator. |
| `kinetis_k22::firmware_image` | Static Library | ELF and raw binary image loader. |
| `kinetis_k22::firmware_runner` | Executable | CLI tool to load and run firmware images. |
| `test` | Utility | Run all tests. |
| `test-coverage` | Utility | Run all tests and print a source coverage summary. |

## Run Firmware

```
kinetis_k22_firmware_runner <IMAGE> --reset-address <ADDRESS> [OPTIONS]
```

### Runner Options

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--reset-address <ADDR>` | Entry point / reset address (required). |
| `--profile <DEVICE>` | K22 device profile. Defaults to `MK22FN51212`. |
| `--package <CODE>` | Package code such as `LH`, `LL`, or `LQ`. |
| `--binary-address <ADDR>` | Base address for raw binary images. |
| `--stop-address <ADDR>` | Execution stop address. |
| `--max-instructions <N>` | Maximum instruction count. |
| `--max-cycles <N>` | Maximum clock cycle limit. |

## Use in CMake Projects

```cmake
add_subdirectory(sim/kinetis-k22-sim EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE kinetis_k22::simulator)
```

## Run Tests

Run all tests:

```
cmake --build build/simulator --target test
```

Run all tests with simulator source coverage:

```
cmake --build build/simulator --target test-coverage
```

The coverage target requires GCC and gcov. It prints the summary after all tests pass.

### Verification Scope

The suite covers core, device, image, and runner behavior. It exhaustively fingerprints all Thumb encodings in three processor states and checks that earlier Thumb-2 decoder groups cannot claim branch encodings.

The fingerprints detect regressions in this simulator. They are not an independent Arm or NXP conformance oracle, and they do not prove exact silicon timing or electrical behavior.
